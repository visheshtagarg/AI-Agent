  "description": "An intelligent multi-agent system that generates personalized, health-aware diet plans. It takes user input such as calorie goals, dietary preferences, and health conditions, then plans optimized daily meals using reasoning, RAG retrieval, and fine-tuned models. The system includes interactive coaching, real-time nutrition lookup, and progress visualization.",
